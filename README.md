# Chess-1.0
Finished the basic Java course from programmieren-starten.de

Fifth real practice project to consolidate what I've learned there.
A very basic console application of the game Chess. Humble beginnings...

This will be the last dedicated practice project for this part of my training,
I will then continue with either the JavaFX module from the course, or transition
to C#, or get into The Odin Project web-dev again. I will decide how to continue
at a later point.

To Do: Pawn promotion
       Rochade
       Win check
       Add check to declare move invalid if movement end is same as starting point
       Properly loop every input prompt in case of invalid turn input
       Fix collision check of Rook.java, and implement same collision check for the condition where the target square is occupied by own piece
       When only an input with a length of 1 is made (in mistake) an error occurs, deal with that hole
