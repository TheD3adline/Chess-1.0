# Chess-1.0
Finished the basic Java course from programmieren-starten.de

Fifth real practice project to consolidate what I've learned there.
A very basic console application of the game Chess. Humble beginnings...

This will be the last dedicated practice project for this part of my training,
I will then continue with either the JavaFX module from the course, or transition
to C#, or get into The Odin Project web-dev again. I will decide how to continue
at a later point.
